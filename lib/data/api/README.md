# Generated CoffeeCardApi

The `CoffeeCardApi` is generated based on a OpenApi specification of the Coffee Card Api using the
packages [swagger_dart_code_generator](https://pub.dev/packages/swagger_dart_code_generator)
, [chopper_generator](https://pub.dev/packages/chopper_generator)
and [chopper](https://pub.dev/packages/chopper).

## Updating the API

To update to a new revision of the OpenApi specification, the OpenApi JSON file is downloaded
from [Cafe Analog CoffeeCard API Swagger](https://analogio.dk/clippy/swagger). The revised OpenApi
specification is then stored at `openapi/coffeecard_api.swagger.json`. Run the code generation build
runner locally to get the updated client.
