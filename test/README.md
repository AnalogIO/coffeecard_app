# Testing guidelines

**Important!** All test files **must** end with `_test.dart` to be caught by the `flutter test`
commandline tool.

## Conventions

- A test description must conform to the _GIVEN_, _WHEN_, _THEN_ syntax. Example: _GIVEN no token in
  SecureStorage WHEN calling onRequest THEN no Authorization Header is added to the request_.
- A test should be limited to only test one case

## Mocking

The [Mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito) package is used for mocking classes in unit tests.

A class which should be mocked, is declared in the `@GenerateMocks([Type])` annotation. Then a Mock
of the class is generated by code generation.

```dart
// Annotation which generates the secure_storage.mocks.dart library and the MockSecureStorage class.
@GenerateMocks([SecureStorage])
void main() {
  // Create mock object.
  var cat = MockSecureStorage();
}
```
