We are rewriting our Coffee card app for Cafe Analog to a new cross platform one in Flutter. The app
allows users to buy and use clip cards in Cafe Analog @ IT University of Copenhagen.

## Getting started

This project relies on autogenerated files for environment configuration and testing. To generate these files run `make generate`. 

A **.env.develop** should be present in the root directory before running code generation. This file should contain the URI of the backend API in the format `coffeeCardUrl="https://the-url"`.
